			<p>Purpose</p>
			<p class="small">
				The purpose is to show everyone that this place (viz. IISER M)
				despite all its issues, does not stop us from doing amazing things
				in life. We have some of the most rare privilege in the nation. Let's not forget
				that the reason we have the freedom to excel, this freedom of speech, is because many struggled 
				to achieve them for, not themselves, but us. Nothing worth having comes without sacrifice. 
				There is always Hope. For those of us who have been burdened with too much pessimism, here 
				is a tiny spark of hope.
				Men and women in this nation, once decided to fight without weapons, and we ended up changing the map
				of this world. Let us see what a set of highly trained individuals (viz. the IISER community)
				can do.
